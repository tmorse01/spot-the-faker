# Spot the Faker - Real-Time Multiplayer Browser Game

Create a real-time party game similar to "Spot the Faker," using:

- **Frontend**: Vite + React + TypeScript
- **Backend**: Convex (Real-time DB / API as a Service)

## Game Concept

- Players join a room via a shareable link.
- Most players are given a **topic** (e.g., "Types of Cheese").
- One random player is secretly assigned as the **Faker** — they don't get the topic.
- Each player must name an example related to the topic when it’s their turn.
- The group can vote to accuse someone of being the Faker after rounds of talking.
- Reveal votes live and award points if they find the Faker (or Faker wins if they survive).

## Frontend Requirements

- Vite project with React and TypeScript.
- Use Tailwind CSS for fast and bright colorful UI styling.
- Animate round timers and voting phases (consider Framer Motion or React Spring for lively animations).
- Build 4 primary screens:
  - **Lobby** (waiting room for players to join)
  - **Game Round** (show topic to non-Fakers, turn-based speaking order)
  - **Voting Phase** (bright "vote now!" countdown)
  - **Results Screen** (reveal who the Faker was with celebratory/confetti animation)

## Backend (Convex) Requirements

- Implement rooms collection (`rooms`) with roomCode, hostId, currentPhase, topic, players array.
- Implement players collection (`players`) with playerId, displayName, isFaker flag, isEliminated flag.
- Server-side Convex functions for:
  - Creating a room
  - Joining a room
  - Starting the game (assign Faker randomly, pick topic)
  - Submitting a turn response
  - Starting voting phase
  - Submitting votes
  - Calculating and broadcasting results

## Bonus Features

- Use simple AI (e.g., OpenAI or local prompt set) to generate random safe/fun topics if needed.
- Fun colorful animations for:
  - Countdown timers ("Ready, Set, GO!")
  - Voting reveal ("X votes for Y!")
  - Confetti / fireworks when winners are announced
- Optional guest usernames at join (no auth at first)

## Technical Notes

- Keep Convex schemas simple and efficient for live query usage.
- Use React Context or Zustand for lightweight global state handling if needed (lobby status, player data).
- Optimize for mobile responsiveness (bright and fast UX).
- Keep animations snappy (~300ms-500ms) to match party game vibe.
